1. A fun app to display superhero card which I built for fun & to practice newly learn jsonb-server & RTK Query.
2. Added another query for the post request with that we populate a from in home page & there you can add the heroes of your desire.
3. Adding Css style to loading & error in super hero page & deploy the json server so change the url of it.
